// This file contains structures describing some different scenarios for the elevator to handle.
// Each structure provides a time range, a number of floors and a sequence of requests being made.
// Make sure your elevator specification handles each of these scenarios correctly.
// In case you would like to add extra structures, you can do so at the end of this file.
